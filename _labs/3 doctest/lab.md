# Lab 3: Creating a multiplier

## Step 1: Writing the code for a multiplier
Create a new python file and write a function that takes two arguments and multiply its arguments. The function should return the multiplied result.
Save and test the function
Make sure that when the value -1 is used as an argument, an exception is thrown TypeError...

## Step 2: Write docstrings
Write docstrings for your module and your function.
Test (using help and __doc__) if the documentation is printed.

## Step 3: Write doctests
Add executable examples to your docstrings and run them through the doctest module. Validate the outcome.
Make sure you test for TypeError as well

### Step 4: Exclude the doctests
Remove the doctests from the comment and add them to an external file, feed the file to the doctest module and validate the outcome.

### Step 5: Hide the doctests
Add the doctest tests to the __test__ dictionary and use help and __doc__ to validate that they are not visible. 
Execute the tests using doctest and validate the outcome

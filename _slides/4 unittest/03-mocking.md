### Test Doubles

> In automated unit testing, it may be necessary to use objects or procedures that look and behave like their release-intended counterparts, but are actually simplified versions that reduce the complexity and facilitate testing. 

A test double is a generic (meta) term used for these objects or procedures

---
### Test Doubles (2)
Different types of test doubles
- Test stub 
  - providing the tested code with "indirect input"
- Mock object 
  - verifying "indirect output" of the tested code, by defining the expectations before the tested code is executed
- Test spy 
  - verifying "indirect output" of the tested code, by asserting the expectations afterwards, without having defined the expectations before the tested code is executed
- Fake object 
  - a simpler implementation, e.g. using an in-memory database in the tests instead of doing real database access
- Dummy object 
  - when a parameter is needed for the tested method but without actually needing to use the parameter

### Mocking
Mocking is simply the act of replacing the part of the application you are testing with a dummy version of that part called a mock.

Instead of calling the actual implementation, you would call the mock, and then make assertions about what you expect to happen.

### benefits of mocking
Benefits of mocking
- Increased speed 
    - Tests that run quickly are extremely beneficial
- Avoiding undesired side effects during testing 
- If you are testing a function which makes calls to an external API, you may not want to make an actual API call every time you run your tests. Youâ€™d have to change your code every time that API changes, or there may be some rate limits, but mocking helps you avoid that.

### Using test doubles
unittest.mock

> unittest.mock is a library for testing in Python. It allows you to replace parts of your system under test with mock objects and make assertions about how they have been used.


---
### Using test doubles (2)
unittest.mock
- provides a core Mock class
- removes the need to create a host of stubs throughout your test suite
- after performing action, assertions about which methods/attributes and arguments where used can be made
- return values can be specified and needed attributes can be set

Additionally, mock provides 
- a patch() decorator that handles patching module and class level attributes within the scope of a test
  along with sentinel for creating unique objects

---
### Using test doubles (3)
unittest.mock classes and decorators
- Mock/ MagicMock 
  - create all attributes and methods as you access them and store details of how they have been used
  - with Mock you can mock magic methods but you have to define them
  - while MagicMock has "default implementations of most of the magic methods."
  - more on this later..
- patch()

If you don't need to test any magic methods, Mock is adequate and doesn't bring a lot of extraneous things into your tests
If you need to test a lot of magic methods MagicMock will save you some time


---
### Using test doubles (4)
An example of Mock/MagicMock
```
>>> from unittest.mock import MagicMock
>>> thing = ProductionClass()
>>> thing.method = MagicMock(return_value=3)
>>> thing.method(3, 4, 5, key='value')
3
>>> thing.method.assert_called_with(3, 4, 5, key='value')
```

---
### Using test doubles (4)
side_effect parameter allows you to perform side effects, 
including raising an exception when a mock is called

```
>>> mock = Mock(side_effect=KeyError('foo'))
>>> mock()
Traceback (most recent call last):
 ...
KeyError: 'foo'
```

---
### Using test doubles (4)
more examples

```
>>> values = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
>>> def side_effect(arg):
...     return values[arg]
...
>>> mock.side_effect = side_effect
>>> mock('a'), mock('b'), mock('c')
(1, 2, 3)
>>> mock.side_effect = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
>>> mock(), mock(), mock()
(5, 4, 3)
```

---
### Patch Decorator
The patch() decorator / context manager makes it easy to mock classes or objects in a module under test.

```
>>> from unittest.mock import patch
>>> @patch('module.ClassName2')
... @patch('module.ClassName1')
... def test(MockClass1, MockClass2):
...     module.ClassName1()
...     module.ClassName2()
...     assert MockClass1 is module.ClassName1
...     assert MockClass2 is module.ClassName2
...     assert MockClass1.called
...     assert MockClass2.called
...
>>> test()
```
